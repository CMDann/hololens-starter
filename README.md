# Hololens Starter

A simple project for getting started with the hololens including the Uniy pugin for the HoloToolKit by Microsoft.

## HoloToolkit-Unity
This is effectively part of the existing HoloToolkit, but this is the repository that will contain all Unity specific components.
The HoloToolkit is a collection of scripts and components intended to accelerate development of holographic applications targeting Windows Holographic.

HoloToolkit contains the following feature areas:

1. [Input](Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/README.md)
2. [Sharing](Assets/HoloToolkit/Sharing/README.md)
3. [Spatial Mapping](Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/README.md)
4. [Spatial Understanding](Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialUnderstanding/README.md)
5. [Spatial Sound](Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialSound/README.md)
6. [Utilities](Assets/HoloToolkit/Utilities/README.md)
7. [Build](Assets/HoloToolkit/Build/README.md)
